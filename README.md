# OTLogger
A chrome extension to keep track of Overtime at work

Quick Update!
I'll be adding Python script which would save the overtime details. Those details would be accessible to Chrome extension. This helps removing chrome storage use completely. Thus, the chrome extension will solely act as a terminal to view details.
